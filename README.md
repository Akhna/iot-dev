# Cloud native IoT projects
Collection of projects that showcase the intersection of cloud-native technologies and the Internet of Things.

## Protocol buffers and IoT devices
It turns out that [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), an efficient binary serialization format, works well as a storage and wire format when developing IoT communication protocols. 

* [Examples](./esp8266) of running protocol buffers on the ESP8266 to create IoT services


## gRPC and IoT
When building services for IoT devices with the characteristics of real-time interactivity, gRPC turns out to be a good choice.  gRPC is a fast and efficient RPC framework that uses protocol bufffers and HTTP2.  

* [Example](./raspberrypi) projects that use gRPC to create IoT services
